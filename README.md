# OpenMRS-Vulnerability-and-Performance-Testing
# Testing Techniques for OpenMRS System

## Overview
This project explores security and performance testing of the **OpenMRS** system, an open-source, Java-based electronic medical record system. OpenMRS is widely used by healthcare providers and requires rigorous testing to ensure system reliability, secure data handling, and optimized performance. Key testing techniques include **Dynamic Analysis**, **Penetration Testing**, and **Performance and Authorization Testing**.

## Project Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:
- To identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities within the OpenMRS system.
- To evaluate system performance under both static and dynamic conditions.
- To ensure that the system meets healthcare industry standards for security, performance, and user experience.

## Project Structure
This project is organized into several key sections:
- **Introduction**: Overview of OpenMRS and the importance of security and performance testing.
- **Objectives**: Focus on securing data and improving system performance for healthcare applications.
- **Methodology**: Explains testing approaches, including:
  - **Dynamic Analysis** and **Penetration Testing** for security vulnerabilities.
  - **Performance and Authorization Testing** to assess component responsiveness.
- **Test Environment Setup**: Detailed instructions for setting up OpenMRS locally and configuring the necessary testing tools, such as OWASP ZAP and React Profiler.
- **Testing Techniques**:
  - **Dynamic Analysis**: Examines system behavior under load and detects security weaknesses.
  - **Penetration Testing**: Simulates attacks to identify system vulnerabilities.
  - **Performance and Authorization Testing**: Evaluates the systemâ€™s performance, focusing on responsiveness and resource utilization.
- **Results**: Discusses findings from each testing technique and provides recommendations for enhancing system security and performance.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm & Yarn**: npm is included with Node.js; Yarn can be installed via `npm install -g yarn`
- **OWASP ZAP**: Download from [OWASP ZAP's official site](https://www.zaproxy.org/)
- **React Developer Tools**: Available as a browser extension for Chrome or Firefox

### Installation
1. **Clone the OpenMRS ESM Core repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-esm-core.git
    ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    cd openmrs-esm-core
    yarn install
    ```
3. **Configure Environment**: Set up necessary environment variables and configure the database for API calls.
4. **Start the Server**:
    ```bash
    yarn run:shell
    ```

### Running Tests
#### 1. **Dynamic Analysis and Penetration Testing**
   - Configure **OWASP ZAP** as a local proxy server.
   - Start a new session, navigate to `http://localhost:8081/`, and initiate the attack for vulnerability scanning.

#### 2. **Performance and Authorization Testing**
   - Use **React Profiler** to track and analyze rendering times.
   - Conduct tests under normal and peak conditions to observe system responsiveness and component re-renders.

## Results
The results of the testing techniques, including vulnerabilities found and performance bottlenecks, are discussed in the paper. Key insights include:
- **Security Issues**: Various vulnerabilities like SQL injections and XSS threats were identified.
- **Performance Insights**: Component-level analysis was conducted to understand rendering efficiency.

## Future Work
Potential improvements include:
- Integrating additional security tests, such as advanced injection attacks.
- Implementing CI/CD pipelines with automated testing to streamline updates and enhance developer confidence.
